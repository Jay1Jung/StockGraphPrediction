## Objectives

1. **Regression Models**:
   - Understand how economic indicators correlate with sector-wise stock movements.
   - Predict how upcoming economic announcements (e.g., CPI or interest rate changes) affect prices within each sector.

2. **Graph-Based Prediction**:
   - Analyze historical graph patterns for individual stocks and predict future trends based on shape analysis.

3. **Technical Indicators**:
   - Use technical analysis tools like:
     - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
     - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
     - **Bollinger Bands**
   - Implement these as additional prediction tools.

## Challenges

- Stock price movements are influenced by **unpredictable factors** beyond economic indicators.
- Critical considerations:
  - How to exclude the effects of unpredictable factors.
  - Alternatively, how to incorporate these factors to improve prediction accuracy.
